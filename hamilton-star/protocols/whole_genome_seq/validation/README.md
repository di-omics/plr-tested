# WGS preparation validation

Purpose: first live/biological validation folder for the Hamilton STAR WGS preparation V2 rail35 workflow.

This folder contains isolated column-1 scripts. Each script performs one biological liquid-handling step, then stops so the plate can be manually sealed, spun, vortexed, thermocycled, or otherwise handled off-deck as needed.

## Current deck logic

- rail48 pos0 = p10 tips
- rail35 pos0 = destination/work 96WP
- rail35 pos1 = chilled source 96WP
- source and destination use the same 96WP plate definition
- source pos1 uses the same XY offsets as destination pos0

## 01 WGS stage-transfer smoke test

Script: `01_wgs_stage_transfer_operator_volume_col1_pos1source_returntips.py`

Scope:
- Source: rail35 pos1, 96WP, column 1
- Destination: rail35 pos0, 96WP, column 1
- Transfer: operator-supplied WGS stage volume into A1:H1
- Tip: p10
- Tip behavior: return tips
- Blowout: 5.0 uL
- Height: 3.3
- Offset: Coordinate(-0.65, 3.35, 0.0)

This is column 1 only and is not the full protocol.

Run:

```bash
export PLR_METHOD_PARAMETERS_FILE=/path/to/operator-approved-method.json
python 01_wgs_stage_transfer_operator_volume_col1_pos1source_returntips.py --mode deck
python 01_wgs_stage_transfer_operator_volume_col1_pos1source_returntips.py
```

After the run, stop the robot workflow and follow the locally approved method
handoff.
